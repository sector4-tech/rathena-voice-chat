## Features

- **Proximity Voice** — Automatically hear players near you on the map. The closer they are, the louder the voice.
- **Push to Talk (PTT)** — Hold a configurable key (default: `V`) to transmit.
- **Open Mic** — Toggle always-on microphone mode.
- **Party / Guild / Room channels** — Dedicated voice channels separate from proximity.
- **Direct Call** — Call any character by name privately via the Voice Call window.
- **Mic & Speaker volume sliders** — Adjustable directly in-game.
- **War Mode** — Separate voice behavior during Guild vs Guild / WoE events.
- **Low latency** — Built on raw TCP + Opus audio codec.

## How It Works

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **voice-server** | Standalone raw TCP server (`src/voice/`) that routes audio between players |
| **map-server hook** | `voice_bridge.cpp` sends player position & auth to voice-server via UDP |
| **Client DLL** | Injected into RO client — captures mic, encodes with Opus, plays back received audio |

Players within range on the same map hear each other automatically. Moving away fades the volume out.

### Proximity Range

| Distance | Volume |
|----------|--------|
| 0 – 1 cell | 100% (full volume) |
| 1 – 14 cells | Gradually fades out |
| > 14 cells | Silent (out of range) |

> Range is configurable via `proximity_full_range` and `proximity_max_range` in `conf/voice_athena.conf`.
